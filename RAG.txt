MAJOR NUTRIENTS
1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Symptoms

N deficiency is typically caused by insufficient N in the soil. Nitrogen deficiency begins as a uniform light green discoloration / yellowing (uniform chlorosis) of the oldest leaves. Yellowing starts from tip to base of the lower leaves and will proceed up. As the deficiency progresses, younger leaves will also become discoloured. Older leaves are golden yellow colour. Growth virtually stops when N deficiency is severe and become shedding of leaves.

Diagnostic Techniques

Nitrogen deficiency is easily diagnosed by symptoms alone, although leaf nutrient analysis can also be helpful. Nitrogen deficiency can be confused with Fe or S deficiency, although the chlorosis in those deficiencies is typically most severe on the youngest leaves. The reverse is true for N deficiency.

Management

Foliar application of 2% urea thrice at fortnightly interval or soil application of 1-2 kg urea / tree or root feeding of 1% urea (1 g/litre of water) 200 ml twice a year.


Potassium (K) Deficiency

Symptoms

Symptoms first appear on oldest leaves and later spread to young leaves.
Translucent yellow or orange spots develop on leaflets (Yellowing of leaf margin).
Older leaves are showing necrotic spotting as well curling of leaflet tips.
Leaflets with necrotic areas along the margins which later wither
The tree appears yellow and nicky, the trunk in slender with few short leaves.
Diagnostic Techniques

Visual symptoms alone may be sufficient for diagnosis of this disorder although leaf nutrient analysis may be helpful in distinguishing late stage K deficiency from manganese (Mn) deficiency. These two deficiencies can be extremely similar from a distance, but close examination should reveal characteristic spotting and marginal necrosis in K deficiency or necrotic streaking for Mn deficiency. Potassium deficiency symptoms are also more severe toward the leaf tip and are less so at the leaf base. The reverse is true for Mn deficiency.

Management

Regular applications of K fertilizers will prevent K deficiency and treat palms already deficient. On sandy soils, or those having little cation exchange capacity, controlled-release K sources are much more effective than the easily leached water-soluble K sources.
Application of resin coated K2SO4 @ 3 - 4 kg/tree, four times a year along with 2 kg MgSO4 / tree.
Root feeding of 200ml of 1% KCL per tree thrice a year.


3. Phosphorus Deficiency

Symptoms

Purple coloration in leaves (In severe cases may leaves turn yellow before drying prematurely)
Sluggish growth
Leaves stay upright
Premature leaf shedding
The growth, leaf size and leaf number reduced. The root growth is restricted if phosphorus deficiency is recorded. There are no clear visual symptoms of phosphorus deficiency other than stunting and decrease in yield.

Management
Foliar spray of DAP 2% twice at fortnightly interval or soil application of FYM 5kg/tree. Root feeding of 1% DAP 2 ml twice a year.

Sulphur Deficiency

Symptoms

Typical symptoms are yellowish-green or yellowish-orange leaflets. Old leaves remain green. Leaves droop as the stem becomes weak. In older palms, leaf number and size are reduced. Sometimes an apron of dead fronds develops around the stem due to weakness of the rachis. Nuts may fall prematurely. Copra is rubbery and of poor market quality.

Management

Soil application of gypsum 2 - 5 kg/tree/year. Root feeding of 0.2% (2g/litre of water) gypsum.

Minor Nutrients

1.Boron (B) Deficiency

Symptoms

Symptoms always occur on newly emerging leaves, and remain visible on these leaves as they mature and are replaced by younger leaves.
One of the earliest symptoms of B deficiency on coconut palm is leaf wrinkling and manifested as sharply bent leaflet tips, commonly called “hook leaf”. Leaves have a serrated zigzag appearance.
Other common symptom is the failure of newly emerging spear leaves to open normally. In a chronic stage, multiple unopened spear leaves may be visible at the apex of the canopy.
Boron deficiency also occurs in inflorescence and nuts. The inflorescence and nuts are become necrotic.
Diagnostic Techniques

Boron deficiency symptoms are quite distinctive and are usually sufficient for diagnosis by themselves. Manganese deficiency produces symptoms similar to those of B deficiency, but no other common deficiency produces symptoms that could be confused with those of B deficiency. Because B deficiency is so transient in nature, the element is immobile within the palm (cannot move from one leaf to another), and deficiencies affect only leaf primordial developing within the bud area, leaf analysis is not particularly useful.

Management

Foliar spray of 0.2 % (2g in 1 lire of water) borax at the rate of 75 – 100 ml per seedling. Spraying is commonly practiced when coconut palms are at the nursery stage. 1 year old – Borax 5-10 g/plant per year 2-3 years old – Borax 15- 20 g/plant per year 4 years old and more – Borax 30 -50 g/plant per 2 years

2.Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Symptoms

Manganese deficiency is very common on alkaline soils. The newest leaves of Mn deficient palms emerge chlorotic with longitudinal necrotic streaks. As the deficiency progresses, newly emerging leaflets appear necrotic and withered on all but basal portions of the leaflets. This withering results in a curling of the leaflets about the rachis giving the leaf a frizzled appearance (frizzle top). In severely Mn- deficient palms, growth stops and newly emerging leaves consist solely of necrotic petiole stubs.

Diagnostic Techniques

Visual symptoms may be sufficient to diagnose this disorder, but leaf nutrient analysis is also suggested, since symptoms of boron (B) deficiency can be similar. Late stage potassium (K) deficiency symptoms are virtually indistinguishable from those of Mn deficiency at a distance and close examination is required to look for characteristic longitudinal streaking and basal symptom distribution of Mn deficiency.

Management

Soil application of MnSO4 @ 25kg/ha


3.Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Symptoms

Magnesium deficiency appears on the oldest leaves of palms as broad chlorotic (yellow) bands along the margins with the central portion of the leaves remaining distinctly green. In severe cases leaflet tips may become necrotic. Older leaves become bronzed and dry appearance. Leaflets show necrosis and turn to reddish brown with translucent spots yellowing starts at the tip and spreads to the base.

Diagnostic Techniques

Visual symptoms alone are usually sufficient to diagnose Mg deficiency. Magnesium deficiency symptoms differ from those of K deficiency in that symptom severity of discoloration K- deficient leaves is usually orange to bronze, shading gradually to green at the base of the leaf, whereas Mg- deficient leaves have distinctly green leaf centers and bright lemon yellow to orange margins.

Management

Soil application of MgSO4 1-2 kg/tree/year. Root feeding of 200 ml of 0.2% MgSO4 twice a year.

4.Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Symptoms

Zinc deficiency is characterized by formation of small leaves wherein the leaf size is reduced to 50%. Leaflets become chlorotic, narrow and reduced in length. In acute deficiency, flowering is delayed. Zinc deficiency will also lead to button shedding.

Management

Soil application of ZnSO4 @ 25kg/ha

5.Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Symptoms

Young leaves exhibit narrow white bands at margins
Interveinal (chlorosis)
Rusty appearance in leaf margin
Rolling up of leaves
Occurs only in acid soil
Management

Soil application of lime based on lime requirement and root feeding of 1% calcium nitrate


6.Copper (Cu) Deficiency

Symptoms

Coppery bluish leaf
Rolling of terminal leaves due to loss of turgor
Leaves appear to be bleached grey
Fail to produce flowers
Management

Soil application of CuSO4 @ 25 kg per ha.

7.Molybdenum (Mo) Deficiency

Symptoms

Chlorotic leaf blade
Small slender leaves
Rosetted plants
Occurrence of whip tail
Management

Root feeding of 0.05% (0.5g/litre of water) Sodium Molybdate

8.Iron (Fe) Deficiency

Symptoms

Iron deficiency usually appears on palms growing in poorly aerated soils or those that have been planted too deeply. Water logged soils and deep planting effectively suffocate the roots and reduce their effectiveness in taking up nutrients such as Fe.
The main symptom of iron deficiency is chlorosis or yellowing between the veins of new leaves (Uniform chlorotic new leaves as the deficiency progresses, the tips become necrotic and leaf size reduced).
Management

Application of Feso4 0.25 to 0.5 kg/tree/year
